# High-dimensional-mixture
Algorithm for minimax optimal high dimensional Gaussian mixture estimation.

This is a Python3 implementation of the High Dimensional Denoised Method of Moments algorithm of CITE. The algorithm builds on the one dimensional [Denoised Method of Moments algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07237). This code builds on the [implementation](https://github.com/Albuso0/mixture) of the one dimensional algorithm.

To get started, run the code in test.py.
